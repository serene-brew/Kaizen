## Why Watch Anime Like a Normie?
Ever tried watching anime from the terminal? 🖥️✨ Yeah, me neither. But one day, while staring into the abyss of CLI tools and minimalism-induced existential dread, we thought: Why not? 🤷‍♂️

Kaizen is here to fulfill that dream (or nightmare, depending on how much you love the terminal). A native, no-nonsense, super-aesthetic TUI for streaming your favorite anime—right from your beloved command line. 🎥🎌

No more context-switching, no more bloated browser tabs screaming at your CPU like it owes them money. With Kaizen, it’s just you, your terminal, and an uninterrupted anime binge-fest.

So, grab your instant ramen 🍜, fire up Kaizen, and let’s go full weeb mode. 🌸✨ Terminal supremacy, but make it anime. 🎉
